Meeting Agenda

    - Review reasons for lost points (missing references and milestones)
    - Ensuring meeting minutes link is included in README
    - Updates on task hashes, milestones, and story points
    - Discussion on the 4th feature: AI model training for channel moderation

Discussion Points

    - We lost points due to missing references to task hashtags and missing milestones. Moving forward, every task must have clear references and milestones.
    - The meeting minutes link must be added to the README file for easier access and documentation consistency.
    - Task hashes have been updated this week. Each task now includes associated milestones, and story points have been assigned accordingly.
    - The 4th feature, training an AI model to moderate channels by detecting inappropriate words, has been initiated. Data sets will be collected and labeled for training.

Summary of Discussion:

    - Brainstormed potential and feasible ideas for the missing feature.
    - Implement a checklist to ensure each task has the correct hashtag reference and milestones before submission.
    - Assign responsibility to update the README file with the meeting minutes link after each session.
    - Ensure all team members align on the newly updated hashes and milestones for accurate tracking.
    - AI model training for content moderation will involve collecting datasets and setting up a preliminary training      model.


Action Items assigned:

    Noah: Update README file with the meeting minutes link and add milestones for each task.
    Andrew: Review and verify all task references to ensure compliance.
    Anthony: Align updated hashes with each issue.
    Victor: Begin researching datasets for AI model training.

Decision Taken:

    - No decisions taken

Next Steps:

    - Gather and preprocess datasets for AI moderation training
    - Start implementing backend for web sockets

The Meeting was adjourned at 6:40pm.
