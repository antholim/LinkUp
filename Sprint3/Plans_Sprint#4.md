## 4. Conclusion
Sprint 4 will focus on refining and optimizing all previously completed features. **All core and additional functionalities have been successfully implemented and work well in our environment.** Test cases will ensure that different input groups are handled correctly, covering a wide range of real-world usage scenarios. The sprint will conclude with system-wide security updates, final UI improvements, and performance enhancements before deployment.

### **Admin Panel Exclusion**
The **Admin Panel** was not implemented as the **TA granted us permission to complete only three out of four major tasks**. We prioritized and successfully completed:
1. **Direct Messaging**
2. **Channel Features**
3. **AI-Powered Message Monitoring**
Since these features were critical to our system's functionality, the Admin Panel was deprioritized in alignment with TA guidelines.
